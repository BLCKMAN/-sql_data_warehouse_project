===============================
Create Database and Schemas
===============================

Script Purpose:
    This script creates a new database named "10k_data_warehouse" after checking if it already exists.
    If the database exists, it is dropped and recreated. Additionally, the script sets up three schemas
    within the database: "bronze", "silver", and "gold".

WARNING:
    Running this script will drop the entire "10k_data_warehouse" database if it exists.
    All data in the database will be permanently deleted. Proceed with caution
    and ensure you have proper backups before running the script.

NOTE:
    You need to run this script in two parts:
    1. First, run the DROP/CREATE DATABASE commands while connected to a different database (like 'postgres')
    2. Then connect to the new database and run the schema creation commands
*/

-- Part 1: Database Creation (run this while connected to 'postgres' database)
-- Drop the database if it exists
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS "10k_data_warehouse";

-- Create the '10k_data_warehouse' database
CREATE DATABASE "10k_data_warehouse"
    WITH 
    OWNER = current_user
    ENCODING = 'UTF8'
    LC_COLLATE = 'en_US.UTF-8'
    LC_CTYPE = 'en_US.UTF-8'
    TEMPLATE = template0
    CONNECTION LIMIT = -1;

-- Part 2: Schema Creation (run this after connecting to the '10k_data_warehouse' database)
-- Connect to the database first: \c 10k_data_warehouse

-- Create the bronze schema for raw data
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS bronze;

-- Create the silver schema for cleaned and transformed data  
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS silver;

-- Create the gold schema for business-ready data
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS gold;

-- Set search path to include all schemas
SET search_path TO bronze, silver, gold, public;

-- Grant usage on schemas to current user (optional, adjust as needed)
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA bronze TO current_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA silver TO current_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA gold TO current_user;

-- Grant create privileges on schemas to current user (optional, adjust as needed)
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA bronze TO current_user;
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA silver TO current_user;
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA gold TO current_user;

-- Verify schemas were created successfully
SELECT 
    schema_name,
    schema_owner
FROM information_schema.schemata 
WHERE schema_name IN ('bronze', 'silver', 'gold')
ORDER BY schema_name;

-- Show current database and schemas
SELECT current_database() as current_db;
